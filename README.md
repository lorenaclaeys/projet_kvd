# projet_kvd
We have divided the project in three files: kdv, graph and main.
-kdv contains our spectral method and our analytical method for two solitons travelling at diffrent speeds, the analytical method for 1 wave and a function that gives the error between the analytical and numerical method.
-graph that implements the space-time plots, the snapshots and the error of the numerical and analytical solution.
-main contains the results of everything we have immplemented, as well as the graphics.

How to use the code? Choose your initial conditions and your parameters in "main" and then run "main".
